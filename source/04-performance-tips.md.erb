## Repeated Queries

In general, you will get better performance out of your database if you group together similar queries.

For example, if your application is making these queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "id" = 12;
SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "id" = 15;
SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "id" = 27;
```

It would be more efficient to make a single SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "id" IN (12, 15, 27);
```

Skylight automatically normalizes all three of the above repeated queries into the following query, allowing us to detect the repetition:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "id" = ?;
```

### Possible Cause: N+1 Query

A very common cause of repeated queries in Rails applications is known as “N+1 Queries”. This happens because you make a request for a single row in one table, and then make an additional request per element in a `has_many` relationship.

Here’s an example offender ([from the Rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations){:target="_blank"}):

```ruby
def show
  client = Client.limit(10)
  @postcodes = client.map { |c| c.address.postcode }
end
```

The mistake here is that you’re making a single query for 10 clients, but then one query for each client to get its address, something like this:

```sql
SELECT * from "clients" LIMIT 10;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 7;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 8;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 10;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 12;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 13;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 15;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 16;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 17;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "id" = 21;
```


#### The Solution

The solution to this problem is “eager loading”, which means specifying ahead of time which associations you will need.

```ruby
def show
  client = Client.includes(:address).limit(10)
  @postcodes = client.map { |c| c.address.postcode }
end
```

Now, Rails will generate the following SQL for you ahead of time, before you get to the `map`:

```sql
SELECT * from "clients" LIMIT 10;
SELECT * from "addresses" WHERE "client_id" IN (7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 21);
```


### Other Possibilities

Skylight will report any kind of repeated query that includes more than 4 repetitions, happens on a regular basis, and consumes a large part of the total request.

This includes those involving `INSERT` statements. We tuned the heuristic for reporting the problems so that virtually all reported problems will benefit from grouping.

Not all repeated queries can be resolved using the “eager loading” technique described above, but because Skylight only reports repeated queries that consume a large part of the total request, your app will likely benefit from fixing it.
