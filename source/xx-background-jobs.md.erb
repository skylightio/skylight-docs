## Welcome to the Background Jobs Alpha!

Thank you so much for your interest in joining the background jobs alpha. If you haven't yet been accepted, make sure that you've submitted an application <%= link_to "here", "/surveys/background_jobs" %>.

Once you have been accepted into the program, you can follow the instructions below to start instrumenting your background jobs with Skylight.

### Alpha Caveats

We are still working through some `TODO`s for background jobs, so there are some limitations to the feature in its current state. These include:
* We currently only support jobs running via ActiveJob, or Sidekiq as a standalone. Click <%= link_to "here", "#probes" %> for a full list.
* Currently, jobs running over 5 minutes will not be tracked (though we are putting the finishing touches on some infrastructure improvements that will raise this limit to one hour)
* Jobs and requests with more than 2,048 items in the event sequence will have their traces "pruned", with "error.code.3" displayed in the UI instead of the trace data. You can read more about this limitation <%= link_to "here", "./troubleshooting#e0003-exceeded-maximum-number-of-spans" %>.


### Submitting Feedback

We may periodically request feedback via the <%= link_to "in-app messenger", "./contributing#reporting-bugs-and-submitting-feedback" %> or by email. In the meantime, if you spot a bug or have any suggestions, please click the "Send feedback" link in the UI and tell us all about it.

## Background Jobs

By default, the Skylight agent only enables itself for web requests. In many cases, your applications might run processes in the background, via <%= link_to "Sidekiq", "https://sidekiq.org/" %>, <%= link_to "Delayed::Job", "https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job" %>, or some other framework. In fact, we recommend moving certain slow actions into background jobs in our <%= link_to "Performance Tips", "./performance-tips#move-third-party-integration-to-workers" %>. This page shows you how to configure Skylight to profile your background jobs so that you can view them separately in the Skylight UI:

<%= image_tag "skylight/docs/background-jobs/background-jobs.png", alt: "Screenshot of the Background Jobs user interface", style: "width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" %>

### Currently Supported Libraries and Frameworks {#probes}

#### We currently have instrumentation for:

* <%= link_to "Sidekiq", "https://sidekiq.org/" %>
* <%= link_to "ActiveJob", "https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html" %> (supporting Sidekiq, Backburner, Que, Delayed::Job, Sneakers, and others)

#### The following probes are in progress, and will be available soon:
* <%= link_to "Delayed::Job", "https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job" %>

<%= link_to "Resque", "https://github.com/resque/resque" %> is officially **not** supported for now, due to incompatibilities between Resque and Skylight's process model (it doesn’t work via ActiveJob either).

### Default Jobs Component Naming {#component-names}
By default, we will detect that you are running jobs and report them as a `worker` component. If you would like to see another name in the Skylight user interface, the component name can be customized, according to the <%= link_to "instructions", "#enabling" %> for your specific configuration setup.

<%= render partial: "note", locals: {
  type: "important",
  note: <<~NOTE
          Customizing the component name only works for background job processes. Web requests will always be reported as `web`.
        NOTE
}%>

### Migrating Your Existing Background Jobs Setup

<%= render partial: "note", locals: {
  type: "important",
  note: <<~NOTE
          If you already have background jobs set up using the legacy method of creating a separate app for your workers and using a third-party gem, click #{link_to "here", "/app/settings/merging"} for details on how to merge these legacy worker apps into their parent apps to maintain data continuity.
        NOTE
}%>

## Enabling Background Job Instrumentation {#enabling}

The process for enabling background jobs instrumentation is straightforward but varies depending on how you configure Skylight and whether or not you use Rails. Be sure you are following the correct set of instructions below.

### Using skylight.yml

#### 1. Upgrade to the latest Skylight agent.

<%= render partial: "background_jobs_version_disclaimer" %>

#### 2. Enable Skylight for your job processing framework. {#enabling-frameworks}

**If you use Sidekiq:**

```yaml
# config/skylight.yml
authentication: <app auth token>
enable_sidekiq: true
```

If you use Sidekiq with ActiveJob, you can enable either the Sidekiq config or the ActiveJob probe (read on to the next section), or both (it's not necessary to do both, but it won't hurt).

**If you use ActiveJob:**
<%= render partial: "note", locals: {type: "important", note: "Make sure to use `+=` and not `=` to add your probe to `config.skylight.probes`, lest you accidentally turn off Skylight's default probes."} %>

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.skylight.probes += %w(active_job)
```

#### 3. [OPTIONAL] Specify a component name.

<%= render partial: "note", locals: {
  note: <<~NOTE
          If you would like to use the default `worker` component name, skip this step. #{link_to "Click here for more information.", "#component-names"}
        NOTE
}%>

**If you would like to use a _custom_ component name:**

Use <%= link_to "environment-specific configuration", "#environment-specific-configuration" %> to override the environment name.

```yaml
# config/skylight.yml
authentication: <app auth token>
enable_sidekiq: true # if you are using sidekiq
worker_component: 'sidekiq' # or <%%= worker_component_name %>
```

<%= render partial: "dynamic_component_names_warning" %>

#### 4. Deploy and watch your data trickle in!

Deploy the above changes following your normal deploy process. Your new worker component should show up in the components selector in the Skylight UI nav bar.

### Using Environment Variables

Alternatively, if you use environment variables to configure Skylight, follow these instructions:

#### 1. Deploy your app with the latest Skylight agent.

<%= render partial: "background_jobs_version_disclaimer" %>

#### 2. Enable Skylight for your jobs.

Set the following environment variables wherever you start your jobs (e.g. in the `Procfile` on Heroku):

```shell
SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION=<app auth token>
SKYLIGHT_ENABLE_SIDEKIQ=true # for sidekiq instrumentation
```

For ActiveJob, you'll need to <%= link_to "enable the probe", "#enabling-frameworks" %> in `config/application.rb` and deploy that change.

#### 3. [OPTIONAL] Specify a component name.

<%= render partial: "note", locals: {
  note: <<~NOTE
          If you would like to use the default `worker` component name, skip this step. #{link_to "Click here for more information.", "#component-names"}
        NOTE
}%>

**If you would like to use a _custom_ component name:**

Set the environment name explicitly wherever you start your jobs. For example:

```shell
SKYLIGHT_COMPONENT=sidekiq
```

## Background Jobs for OSS Apps {#oss}

<!-- TODO: [jobs] Link here from OSS page when un-beta-ing -->
<!-- TODO: [jobs] Remove this note when un-beta-ing -->

<%= render partial: "note", locals: {
  note: <<~NOTE
          The Background Jobs alpha is not currently available for OSS apps. Please stay tuned!
        NOTE
}%>

By default, the Skylight agent only enables itself for web requests, but enabling Skylight for background jobs is super easy!

We welcome our <%= link_to "Skylight for Open Source", "/oss" %> customers and their contributors to profile their background jobs so that you can view them separately in the Skylight UI:

<%= image_tag "skylight/docs/background-jobs/background-jobs-oss.png", alt: "Screenshot of the Background Jobs for OSS user interface", style: "width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" %>

If you would like to help an open source app enable Skylight background job instrumentation, click <%= link_to "here", "#background-jobs" %> to learn about Background Jobs, then open a PR to the open source project.
