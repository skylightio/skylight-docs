title: Sinatra Apps
---

Skylight supports Sinatra applications out of the box. What this means is that you
can use the same Skylight gem for Sinatra apps and Rails apps.

Sinatra apps usually do not require all gems in the `Gemfile`, so you will want
to add a line like this to your main file:

```rb
require "skylight/sinatra"
```

You will also need to boot up the Skylight agent explicitly:

```rb
Skylight.start!
```

You generally do not want to run Skylight in development mode, and the most common
way to do that in Sinatra apps is to use the `:production` environment.

```rb
configure :production do
  require "skylight/sinatra"
  Skylight.start!
end
```

You don't need to install any middleware manually, or do anything with unicorn
forking settings.

When working with Sinatra, you'll want to use environment variables to
configure Skylight (most notably the authentication token). Skylight doesn't
support YAML-file configuration in Sinatra apps.

The authentication token will be emitted into `config/skylight.yml` when you
run `bundle exec skylight setup`, and you should provide it to your production
app as `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION`.


> NOTE: Padrino is not currently supported as it differs from base Sinatra in
> some significant ways. We are investigating adding support in future releases.
