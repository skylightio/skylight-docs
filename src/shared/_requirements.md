Currently, Skylight supports the following:

* **Ruby** versions 1.9.3, 2.0.x, 2.1.x
* **Rails** versions 3.x and 4.x

We recommend running the latest version of the Skylight rubygem.

After June 15th 2014, support for versions older that 0.3.x will
be dropped.

Although we currently only officially support the Ruby on Rails
framework, it is possible to get Skylight working with any Rack
application with [custom
instrumentation](/agent#custom-instrumentation).
