Currently, Skylight supports the following:

* **Ruby** versions 1.9.3, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x (memory allocation measurement
  requires 2.1+)
* **Rails** versions 3.x and 4.x _OR_ **Sinatra** 1.2+
* **Linux** kernel version 2.6.18+

We recommend running the latest version of the Skylight rubygem.

Although we currently only officially support the Ruby on Rails
framework, it is possible to get Skylight working with any Rack
application with [custom
instrumentation](/agent#custom-instrumentation).
