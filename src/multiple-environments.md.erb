title: Setting Up Multiple Environments
---

In many cases, your applications will have two or more production-like
environments.  These are typically referred to as "production" and "staging",
and you may also have "test", "QA", "dev", etc. environments.

You can configure Skylight to separate data for each of these environments by
creating a new application for each, and then configuring Skylight to use the
appropriate app on a per-environment basis.

To create a new environment, make a directory using the name you'd like:

    mkdir /tmp/appname-staging
    cd /tmp/appname-staging
    skylight setup

Running the `skylight setup` command will create a new application on Skylight,
using the directory name as the default. You can always change the application's
name via the Skylight web UI.

Once `skylight setup` has finished running, a new `config/skylight.yml` file
will be generated containing a new application ID and authentication token.

You'll need to [configure](/agent#configuration) this new environment with these
new credentials.
